Suncat Warriors
===============
#### *Magato-neko*

Goals
-----

Fast, crazy, and brutal like Samurai Gunn.  Maybe a little of the multi-path strategery of Killer Queen.

Important(?) Decisions
----------------------

* Is health binary, or are there HP?
* Unity or other?
* LAN play?

Controls
--------

Movement Stick, Jump, Melée, Ranged Button, Ranged Stick

Dodge?  Block?

The ranged stick is used by pointing it in the direction of your target and letting go.  When playing couch coöp, Show Targeting mode (a per-player setting) will draw a thin line along the projectile's path.  In any situation, the character will animate to indicate aiming.

The ranged button will send a projectile in the direction that the movement stick is held.  If the stick is centered, it will fire the direction that the player is facing.

Attacks and Damage
------------------

* equipment can be damaged, but is repaired for free at the end of the [match or round].

Fortune
-------

Fortune are the coins that power your attacks and abilites.

Attacks
-------

* melée: sword
* close melée: claws
* ranged: thrown Fortune

Specials
--------

* fire breath
  * quarter circle, ranged

  * half circle, melée

  * all other players chase the dot, while you are free to slaughter them
    * possible dot movements customized to each stage

Forms

Every form should have a good name, even the base cats.

* Amelia Earnick

Stages
------

* Darkness
* Local LAN mode would enable some very interesting possibilities involving secret information

User Interface
--------------

Rounds won are indicated by claw icons.  Matches won are indicated by match icons.  I want them to be reminiscent of the NES exclamation points if that's possible.

Graphics
--------

The visual theme is 1600-1875 Japan, mostly, with some Spain from the same era as well.  Plus tiny chunks of pop culture from the last 75 years.

Names
-----

A Spanish cat is a *SolGato* or a *gato invitado*.
