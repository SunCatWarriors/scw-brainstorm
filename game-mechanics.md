User Interface
--------------

Rounds won are indicated by claw icons.  Matches won are indicated by match icons.  I want them to be reminiscent of the NES exclamation points if that's possible.

Graphics
--------

The visual theme is 1600-1875 Japan, mostly, with some Spain from the same era as well.  Plus tiny chunks of pop culture from the last 75 years.

Names

A Spanish cat is a *SolGato* or a *gato invitado*.
